# Deep Learning–Driven Pneumonia Screening from X-Ray Images

## 📌 Project Description
This repository contains the technical implementation of a comparative study evaluating **ResNet-50 (CNN)** and **ViT-B/16 (Vision Transformer)** for detecting pneumonia from chest X-rays.

The project focuses on:
* **Handling Class Imbalance:** Implementing weighted sampling to improve detection of normal cases.
* **Model Comparison:** Analyzing performance metrics (Precision, Recall, F1-Score) between CNN and Transformer architectures.
* **Explainability:** Visualizing model decisions using **Grad-CAM** (for ResNet) and **Attention Maps** (for ViT).

The Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16) achieved the best performance with **92% accuracy** after fine-tuning.

## 📂 Dataset
The model was trained and evaluated on the **Kaggle Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)** dataset.
